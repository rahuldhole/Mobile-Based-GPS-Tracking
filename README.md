# Mobile based GPS Tracking System - Empowering University Bus Tracking
As an extracurricular activity, I developed the Android GPS Tracking System, fueled by my passion for creating meaningful solutions. Using PhoneGap, I designed both frontend and backend, employing JavaScript, Cordova, SQL, and PHP.

### Objective:
To provide a robust tracking system for university bus drivers, enabling students to effortlessly track the real-time bus location.

### Key Achievements:

- Cross-platform solution using PhoneGap for Android and iOS.
- Intuitive frontend for students to view live bus locations on a map.
- Secure the backend using PHP and SQL for efficient data storage.
- Cordova to access device GPS for accurate location updates.
- Reliable communication between app and server for smooth data exchange.

### Functional Highlights:

- Real-time Bus Tracking: Students track the bus on their smartphones, reducing waiting times.
- Live Map View: Interactive map displays the bus's position and updates dynamically.
- User Authentication: Secure login to ensure authorized access.
- Efficiency for Bus Drivers: Provides efficient routes and insights into student demand.

### Impact:
The Android GPS Tracking System transforms campus transportation, enhancing the student experience. It demonstrates my proactive problem-solving and full-stack development skills in JavaScript, Cordova, SQL, and PHP.
